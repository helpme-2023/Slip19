Design a Django application that adds web pages with views and templates.

Create a New Django Project and App
# Create a new Django project
django-admin startproject myproject
# Create a new Django app
cd myproject
python manage.py startapp myapp

Define Views for Each Page
Inside your app directory (e.g., myapp), open the views.py file.
Define a view function for each web page you want to create. For example, let's create two pages: "home" and "about":
from django.shortcuts import render
def home(request):
    return render(request, 'myapp/home.html')
def about(request):
    return render(request, 'myapp/about.html')

Create Templates
Create HTML templates for each page in your app's template directory. 
By default, Django expects templates to be located in myapp/templates/myapp/. Create two HTML files named home.html and about.html inside this directory:
myapp/templates/myapp/home.html:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Home Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the Home Page</h1>
    <p>This is the home page of our website.</p>
</body>
</html>

myapp/templates/myapp/about.html:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>About Us</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We are a team of developers learning Django.</p>
</body>
</html>

Create URL Mappings
In your app directory, create a myapp/urls.py file (if it doesn't exist) and define URL patterns for the views:
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
    path('about/', views.about, name='about'),
]

Configure Project URL Routing
In your project's urls.py file (e.g., myproject/urls.py), include the URL patterns from your app:
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('myapp.urls')),
]

Run the Development Server
Start the development server with the following command:
python manage.py runserver
Access the Web Pages
Home Page: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
About Page: http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/
